- 👋 Hi, I’m @CintriData. My real name is Marion. I have a M.S. in Information Systems and am always on the lookotu for learning more. This GitHub profile is likely
      Posted on my resume and/or other social media like my LinkedIn profile. I have other non-tech interests, so you should talk to me if you also like:
      Gardening, especially hydroponics, chicken hobbying, rocks, art, and baking!
- 👀 I’m interested in learning/honing my skills in Python and SQL. I'd also like to start some simple projects to strengthen my portfolio.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, and gaining better knowledge in general IT concepts! Although I hold a degree in Information Systems, I think learning and keeping updated is important.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything simple right now, and if you would like me to help with simple 2D level design on Unreal Engine 5, feel free to contact me! 
      That was my role in the last project I was apart of.
