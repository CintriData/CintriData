- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @CintriData. My real name is Marion. I have an M.S. in Information Systems.
-  I have other non-tech interests, so you should talk to me if you also like:
      Gardening, bird watching, keeping, rocks, art, and baking!
      
      
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m honing my Python and SQL skills on this profile. Right now I am working on a project called Chickidex. Chickidex is like that of a Pokedex from Pokemon, except with chickens. 
      The goal is to create a program for quick bird identification for further independent poultry research.
